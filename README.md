# **House Price Prediction Web App**

A Flask-based web application for house price prediction with user authentication, model training, and prediction history tracking.[1]

## **Overview**

This project provides a **machine learning–powered** house price predictor exposed through a Flask web interface. Users can register, log in, submit property details, get a price estimate in INR, and view their personal prediction history stored in a SQLite database.[1]

## **Features**

- House price prediction using a Linear Regression model with standardized features: area, bedrooms, bathrooms, age, garage, yard size, and distance to city.[1]
- Automatic dataset generation (`dataset_generator.py`) and model training if `data/house_prices.csv` or saved model files are missing.[1]
- User authentication: registration, login, logout, and secure password hashing via Werkzeug.[1]
- SQLite database with SQLAlchemy models for `User` and `PredictionHistory` (one-to-many relationship).[1]
- Dashboard showing dataset statistics (count, average/min/max price, average area, bedrooms, bathrooms) in INR.[1]
- Prediction history page with timestamps converted to Asia/Kolkata (IST) timezone.[1]
- `/retrain` endpoint to retrain the model on demand and return updated MSE and R² as JSON.[1]

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: Flask (Python) for routing, sessions, and Jinja2 templates.[1]
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM.[1]
- **ML & Data**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn (LinearRegression, StandardScaler, train_test_split, metrics), pickle.[1]
- **Auth & Time**: Werkzeug security for password hashing, `datetime` and `pytz` for timezone handling.[1]

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure `Flask`, `Flask-SQLAlchemy`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `pytz`, and `Werkzeug` are included.[1]

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The app runs in debug mode and will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.[1]

5. **Access the app**

   - Open the home page in your browser.  
   - Register a new account, then log in to access the prediction form and history pages.[1]

## **Project Structure**

- `app.py` – Main Flask application, routes, database models, and ML logic (training, prediction, retraining).[1]
- `data/house_prices.csv` – Synthetic housing dataset (autogenerated if missing).[1]
- `model/model.pkl` – Trained Linear Regression model (autogenerated if missing).[1]
- `model/scaler.pkl` – StandardScaler for feature scaling (autogenerated if missing).[1]
- `templates/` – HTML templates: `home.html`, `index.html`, `login.html`, `register.html`, `history.html`, `users.html`.[1]

## **Notes**

- Currency is converted from USD to INR using a configurable rate (currently hardcoded as 86) before display.[1]
- The database (`users.db`) is created automatically on first run using SQLAlchemy’s `create_all()` within the Flask app context.[1]
